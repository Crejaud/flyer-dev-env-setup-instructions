# Zubi Flyer Development Environment Setup Instructions

Hello there. If you want to start hacking with your Zubi Flyer board, please follow the following instructions:

[Contact Support](fuzeplay.co) if you're running into any issues, we'll be happy to help you out :)

## 1. Install the Arduino IDE
  ![Arduino Logo](https://www.arduino.cc/en/pub/skins/arduinoWide/img/ArduinoAPP-01.svg)
  
  The Zubi Flyer is built using [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) hardware and software. 
  
  Arduino is a hardware and software platform for hobbyists and Engineers to make neat electronics projects.
  
  If you want to write and modify the Arduino code that controls your Zubi Flyer, you'll first need to install the Arduino IDE on your laptop. 
  
  An IDE is an "Integrated Development Enviroment" and is used by Computer Programmers to write and modify code, and then turn that code into a computer program.

## 2. Install Zubi Flyer Library
  After you've installed the Arduino IDE, you'll need to install Fuze's Zubi Flyer Library. 
  
  In Computer Programming, a "Library" is code that somebody else that you can copy and modify.
  
  For example, if you want to modify the [Newbie-Zubi]() game on your Zubi Flyer, you don't have to write the code for the entire game on your own, you would use the Newbie-Zubi code that we already wrote and put in the Zubi Flyer Library.
## 3. Install Arduino Drivers
  A "Driver" is software that lets different hardware talk to each other.
  
  If you plug your mouse into a laptop, your laptop has Drivers that tell the laptop what kind of mouse it is and how to understand mouse movements and turn those into the cursor moving on your screen.
  
  The Zubi Flyer is like a mouse, when you plug it into your laptop, your laptop needs a driver to understand what the Zubi Flyer is and how to upload to it.
